ESP32-C3
---------------------------

Unique examples that are only compatible with the ESP32-C3 models.


For more ESP32 Solutions I highly encourage you to check-out my ESP32 & Arduino repositories considering all of the programs are compatible and have been tested on the ESP32-C3: https://github.com/AlexandrosPanag/My_Espressif_Systems/tree/main/ESP32. 

along with my official Arduino repository, provided the necessary pin on sensors changes are made:

The codes were compiled on the model ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 was provided to me by the Autonomous Systems Laboratory on the University of Ioannina, Department of Informatics & Telecommunications, along with my own personal model ESP32-C3-DEVKITM-1.
