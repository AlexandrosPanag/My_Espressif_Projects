ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02
---------------------------

Unique examples that are only compatible with the ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 model.


For more ESP32 Solutions I highly encourage you to check-out my ESP32 main branch considering all of the programs are compatible and have been tested on the ESP32-C3 (just make sure the pins are connected to the appropriate pin positions!) : https://github.com/AlexandrosPanag/My_Espressif_Systems/tree/main/ESP32. 
In order to avoid the use of re-uploading the same codes I highly advise you to check out this repository!
