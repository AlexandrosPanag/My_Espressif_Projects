Multiple Board Solutions
----------

This repository contains solutions for multiple boards (ESP32-C3,ESP8266,ESP-32) with different modules that can co-operate to produce results. In order to verify and see the different results the code (or codes) will need to operate on more than one board.

Make sure you read the description of each project in order to ensure that the codes compile and operate optimally!
