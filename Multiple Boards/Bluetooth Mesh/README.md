Bluetooth Mesh
-----

This example illustrates how different modules can connect into a network and communicate with each other to send a message and receive a message and create a local network with the use of bluetooth. In this example 3 of my Espressif microcontrollers (ESP32-C3-DEVKITM-1,ESP32 DevKit, ESP8266) were used to create a Bluetooth Mesh network.
