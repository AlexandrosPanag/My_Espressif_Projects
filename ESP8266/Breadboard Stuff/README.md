An example of how we can use a Digital Pin to turn on and off an external LED Light.

Note that putting 2 for example instead of 4, even though our board is connected to D2 WILL NOT turn the light on
we need the GPIO reference which can be found here: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-pinout-reference-gpios/
