ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02
---------------------------

Unique examples that are only compatible with the ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 model. All of the programs are compatible with my ESP32 Repository which can be found here: https://github.com/AlexandrosPanag/My_Espressif_Systems/tree/main/ESP32. In order to avoid the use of re-uploading the same code I highly advise you to check out this repository!

The model ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 was provided to me by the Autonomous Systems Laboratory on the University of Ioannina, Department of Informatics & Telecommunications.
