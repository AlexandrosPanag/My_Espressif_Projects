SPI_DEBUG
------------------------

A very useful program which was originally made by @Rui_Santos (https://github.com/RuiSantosdotme) on Random Nerd Tutorials at https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-spi-communication-arduino/.


This program helps in order to find the your ESP's SPI Pins, which can in turn, assist in the proper communication between the ESP32 Dev Module and sensors like the Adafruit BME 280

I have improved the code in order to identifiy the SDA & SCL Pins
