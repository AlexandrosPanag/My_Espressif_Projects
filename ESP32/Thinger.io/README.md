--------------------------------------
What is Thinger.io?
--------------------------------------
Thinger.io is a cloud IoT Platform that provides every needed tool to prototype, scale and manage connected products in a very simple way. Our goal is to democratize the use of IoT making it accessible to the whole world, and streamlining the development of big IoT projects.

Free IoT platform: Thinger.io provides a lifetime freemium account with only few limitations to start learning and prototyping when your product becomes ready to scale, you can deploy a Premium Server with full capacities within minutes.
Simple but Powerful: Just a couple code lines to connect a device and start retrieving data or controlling its functionalities with our web-based Console, able to connect and manage thousands of devices in a simple way.

Hardware agnostic: Any device from any manufacturer can be easily integrated with Thinger.io's infrastructure.


Extremely scalable & efficient infrastructure: thanks to our unique communication paradigm, in which the IoT server subscribes device resources to retrieve data only when it is necessary, a single Thinger.io instance is able to manage thousands of IoT devices with low computational load, bandwidth and latencies.


Open-Source: most of the platform modules, libraries and APP source code are available in our Github repository to be downloaded and modified with MIT license.
